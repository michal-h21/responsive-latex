# The `Responsive` Package

Change font sizes and other typographic details in LaTeX documents depending on
the page dimensions.

The Responsive package for LaTeX enables dynamic adjustment of document
elements for various output formats and devices. Key features include:

- Font Size Adjustment: Set the font size to achieve an average number of
  characters per line, enabling suitable font size selection for various sizes
  of page formats or devices such as tablets and e-book readers.

- Typographic Scales: Choose from predefined or define custom typographic
  scales using options such as number and ratio.

- Media Queries: Test document properties using media queries, allowing
  conditional execution of code based on test results.

- Line Spacing Control: adjust line spacing determining the x-height percentage
  for enhanced readability.
