Responsive design aims to display text and other design elements well on
variety of outputs, including electronic devices or various paper sizes.
It originated on the Web, where it uses Cascading Style Sheets to change 
design elements. 

This package tries to achieve similar result with \LaTeX. The main aim is to 
support output of multiple editions of one document with 
readable font sizes regardless of the physical size of the produced PDF,
from smartphones or e-ink readers to printed A4.
